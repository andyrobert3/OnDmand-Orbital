# OnDmand

OnDmand is a web app that allows employers and part-time job seekers to connect with each other.
<br />
A user is able to sign up and login providing his/her credentials such as previous jobs/internships, location and minimum acceptable wage. 

<br />

Then the user can post a part-time job opportunity, the potential job seeker can open the look at the job details and enter a chatroom where both parties can chat with each other (socket.io) 

<br /> 

Once the user is satisified with the opportunity, he/she can accept the job offer. 

<br />

Web App was made with HTML CSS at the frontend, the backend used Node JS with Express as the framework. Socket.io is used for the chatroom & Passport for authentication (login/signup). Database is implemented with MySQL.
